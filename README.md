# Tech Recommender AI

A web app that recommends laptops and mobile phones based on natural language queries (e.g., "laptop under â‚¹70,000 for coding"). It scrapes data from Amazon, Flipkart, GSM Arena, Croma, and MDComputers, uses NLP for query parsing, and ranks products with weighted scoring.

2. Install dependencies: `pip install playwright requests beautifulsoup4`
3. Install Playwright browsers: `playwright install`

## Status
- Week 1: Project structure set up, Git initialized, dependencies installed. Next: Scraping Amazon, Flipkart, and fallback sites.
